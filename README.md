# MirageKit

MirageKit is a window and desktop streaming framework for Apple platforms. It provides a macOS host service for capturing windows or virtual displays and a client service for discovering hosts, receiving low‑latency video over UDP, and forwarding input back to the host. SwiftUI views are included for rendering streams with Metal on macOS, iOS, and visionOS.

> ⚠️ MirageKit is still in active development and may introduce breaking changes.

## Features

- Window, app, and full desktop streaming from macOS hosts
- Bonjour discovery with TCP control + UDP video transport
- Peer-to-peer connections over AWDL
- Adaptive quality presets and encoder configuration helpers
- Input forwarding (mouse, keyboard, scroll, gestures)
- SwiftUI stream view for macOS, iOS, and visionOS
- Virtual display capture for pixel‑perfect rendering
- Remote session state + unlock support
- Menu bar passthrough and app‑centric streaming utilities

## Requirements

- macOS 26+ for host streaming (ScreenCaptureKit)
- iOS 26+ / visionOS 26+ for client streaming
- Swift 6.2+

## Installation

Add MirageKit as a Swift Package Manager dependency.

```swift
// Package.swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/EthanLipnik/MirageKit.git", from: "1.0.0"),
```

Then add `MirageKit` to the relevant target dependencies.

## Quick Start

### Host (macOS)

```swift
import MirageKit

@MainActor
final class HostController: MirageHostDelegate {
    private let hostService = MirageHostService()

    init() {
        hostService.delegate = self
    }

    func start() async throws {
        try await hostService.start()
    }

    func hostService(_ service: MirageHostService, shouldAllowClient client: MirageConnectedClient, toStreamWindow window: MirageWindow) -> Bool {
        true
    }
}
```

### Client (iOS/macOS/visionOS)

```swift
import MirageKit

@MainActor
final class ClientController: MirageClientDelegate {
    let clientService = MirageClientService()

    init() {
        clientService.delegate = self
    }

    func connect(to host: MirageHost) async throws {
        try await clientService.connect(to: host)
        try await clientService.requestWindowList()
    }

    func clientService(_ service: MirageClientService, didDecodeFrame pixelBuffer: CVPixelBuffer, forStream streamID: StreamID, contentRect: CGRect) {
        MirageFrameCache.shared.store(pixelBuffer, contentRect: contentRect, for: streamID)
    }
}
```

### SwiftUI Stream View

```swift
import MirageKit
import SwiftUI

struct StreamView: View {
    let streamID: StreamID
    @State private var latestFrame: CVPixelBuffer?
    @State private var contentRect: CGRect = .zero

    var body: some View {
        MirageStreamViewRepresentable(
            streamID: streamID,
            latestFrame: $latestFrame,
            contentRect: contentRect,
            onInputEvent: { event in
                // Forward event to MirageClientService
            },
            onDrawableSizeChanged: { size in
                // Use to request updated capture resolution
            }
        )
    }
}
```

## How It Works

- Hosts advertise via Bonjour using `_mirage._tcp` and accept TCP control connections.
- Video payloads stream over UDP; clients register stream IDs to receive data.
- The host can create a shared virtual display sized to the client’s display for 1:1 pixels.
- Session state updates allow remote unlock flows (login screen vs locked session).
- Menu bar passthrough enables clients to render native menu structures and send actions back.

## Configuration

### Quality Presets

`MirageQualityPreset` provides ready-made profiles that map to encoder defaults.

- `.ultra` / `.high`: 120fps with high bitrate caps
- `.medium`: 60fps balanced profile
- `.low`: 30fps reduced bandwidth
- `.adaptive`: 120fps with adaptive bitrate caps
- `.lowLatency`: tuned for text apps with aggressive frame skipping

Each preset can be overridden per stream with `maxBitrate`, `keyFrameInterval`, and `keyframeQuality` when starting a stream.

### Encoder Settings

`MirageEncoderConfiguration` lets you control codec, bitrate, frame rate, color space, and adaptive bitrate behavior.

- Use `.highQuality`, `.balanced`, or `.lowLatency` presets.
- Use `withOverrides` or `withMaxBitrate` to apply client-specific limits.
- Use `withTargetFrameRate` to request 60/120fps based on display capabilities.

### Networking

`MirageNetworkConfiguration` defines discovery and transport behavior.

- `serviceType` is used for Bonjour discovery.
- `controlPort` (TCP) and `dataPort` (UDP) support explicit or auto-assigned ports (defaults: 9847/9848).
- `enablePeerToPeer` turns on AWDL peer-to-peer discovery and connections.
- `maxPacketSize` controls UDP payload sizing (default stays within IPv6 MTU).

### Streaming Modes

- Window streaming captures a specific window using ScreenCaptureKit.
- Desktop streaming mirrors a virtual display and supports display-sized capture.
- App streaming groups windows by bundle identifier and tracks newly spawned windows.

### Input + UI

- Input events are forwarded via `MirageInputEvent` types (mouse, key, scroll, magnify, rotate).
- `MirageStreamViewRepresentable` renders streams with Metal and exposes drawable size callbacks for resolution sync.
- The host uses `MirageHostDelegate` and the client uses `MirageClientDelegate` for approvals and state changes.

## Permissions

The macOS host uses ScreenCaptureKit and may require Screen Recording permission. To forward input or activate windows, the host app may also need Accessibility permission. Clients should have Local Network permission for Bonjour discovery.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Most of this framework was built with agentic coding tools (Claude Code and Codex). Using them is fine as long as you understand and can explain the changes you submit.
